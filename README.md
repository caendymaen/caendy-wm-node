# Todo
create structure

first check, if instance is already running, if so send arguments to running instance and quit

if no instance is running open socket for receiving arguments and initialize the node setup

node setup:

initialize dbus clients!!!

find a way for setting up some services like Notifications or Button feedback like volume up/down - so already running react apps, which then just need to open a window/layer on dbus signals, etc.

create some "standard" apps - not a musthave to be already running like services
one could be a "settings" app, where the standard-apps can be set up to autostart

maybe another app to set up your own apps in a gui?
apps... more or less widgets or whatsoever, to firstly a standardization of config files must be finished, which is interpreted by a "custom" react app
